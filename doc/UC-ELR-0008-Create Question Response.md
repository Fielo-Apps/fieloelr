   4. End of flow
##### 2. Question lookup field is null (step 4 of basic flow)
   1. The system verifies that the Question field is null
   2. The system does not create the question response
   3. The system displays an error message
   4. End of flow

##### 3. Number of Attempts is greater than the “Attempts Allowed per Question” of related module (step 6 of basic flow)
   1. The system verifies that the “Number of Attempts” is greater than the “Attempts Allowed per Question” of related module
   2. The system does not create the question response
   3. The system displays an error message
   4. End of flow

##### 4. Delete a question response not submitted (step 8 of basic flow)
   1. The administrator presses the Delete button
   2. The system verifies that the question response is not submitted
   3. The system deletes the question response
   4. The system deletes all related answers responses
   5. End of flow

##### 5. Delete a question response already submitted (step 8 of basic flow)
   1. The administrator presses the Delete button
   2. The system verifies that the question response is submitted
   3. The system does not delete the question response
   4. The system displays an error message
   5. End of flow

##### 6. Edit a question response not submitted (step 8 of basic flow)
   1. The administrator presses the Edit button
   2. The administrator makes the desired changes 
   3. The administrator presses the Save button
   4. The system verifies that the question response is not submitted
   5. The system verifies that all other validations succeed
   6. The system updates the question response
   7. The system displays the question response detail page 
   8. End of flow

##### 7. Edit a question response already submitted (step 8 of basic flow)
   1. The administrator presses the Edit button
   2. The administrator makes the desired changes 
   3. The administrator presses the Save button
   4. The system verifies that the question response is submitted
   5. The system does not update the question response
   6. The system displays an error message
   7. End of flow

##### 8. Submit a question response when there is no correct question response for the related question (step 8 of basic flow)
   1. The administrator presses the Edit button 
   2. The administrator changes the field “IsSubmitted” from “false” to “true”
   3. The system verifies that the related question doesn’t have another correct question response
   4. The system calls the use case [*Determine Question Response Correction*](https://github.com/FieloIncentiveAutomation/fieloelr/blob/feature/elrbackend/doc/UC-ELR-0011-Determine%20Question%20Response%20Correction.md)
   5. The system updates the question response
   6. The system displays the question response detail page
   7. End of flow

##### 9. Submit a question response when there is already another correct question response for the related question (step 7 of basic flow)
   1. The administrator presses the Edit button 
   2. The administrator changes the field “IsSubmitted” from “false” to “true”
   3. The system verifies that the related question has already another correct question response
   4. The system does not update the question response
   5. The system displays an error message
   6. End of flow
